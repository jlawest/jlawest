### Hello, I'm Josh ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about learning and developing my skills in Python and applying that learning to developing programs, analysing data, utilising ML and everything else in between. Here you'll find a collection of my projects, contributions, and explorations in the world of software development and data analytics. 

## About Me
